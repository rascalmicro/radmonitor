* Abstract
For security, environmental, and regulatory purposes it is useful to monitor
wide areas for unexpected changes in radioactivity.  Background radiation from
naturally radioactive materials presents the largest challenge to detection
sensitivity.  Most commonly, a single background spectrum is recorded and all
subsequent spectra are compared to this static background. We have developed a
temporal anomaly detection algorithm which uses multiple passes across an area
to build a spatial map of background spectra, allowing increased sensitivity to
anomalies. By comparing spectral shape rather than count rate we increase
sensitivity and limit the influence of the background-dominated low-energy
region. To demonstrate this technique, we performed source injection
simulations, simple source detection tests, and blind tests at University of
Texas football games. Applications in wide-area monitoring through detectors on
vehicles, such as buses, are explored.
* Introduction
** Project goals
 - Develop wide-area mapping and change detection for gamma rays
 - Potential applications in nuclear security
 - Example use-case: wide-area surveillance of a city through buses
** Prior work
 - PNNL's anomaly detection schemes with a scintillator in a truck
 - Gamma imaging
 - Border portal monitors
 - Aerial mapping of cities (Seattle, NYC)
 - Radiation pagers
** Thesis scope
 - Developed new anomaly detection algorithm for areal mapping and anomaly
   detection
