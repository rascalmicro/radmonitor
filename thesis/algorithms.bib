abstract = {We discuss the determination of energy region (bin) boundaries and decision metrics for gamma-ray spectra, acquired using a mid-resolution detector, that are useful for detecting illicit sources at low total counts. The bins are designed to produce the lowest minimum detectable counts using a spectral comparison ratio technique at a given false-positive rate for a specified popu- lation of benign-source spectra. Spectra from the benign source population consist of observations taken by a detector on a moving vehicle, as would be obtained during a search for a missing or hidden source. Raw counts in bins are transformed into a vector of background-corrected count differences. Bin boundaries are determined to yield large values of a standardized length of this vector for benign-plus-benchmark sources by applying an optimization technique. The objective function includes penalties for overlap with the spectral features of naturally occurring radioactive materials. We compare estimated minimum detectable count values for such bins applied to depleted uranium and barium-133 sources with those based on gross counting, and we examine the effect of nuisance potassium-, radium- and thorium-dominated sources. Using this methodology, we demonstrate that energy bins may be chosen to be sensitive to special nuclear materials, improving the likelihood of detection in low-count or masked-source searches.},

abstract = {Searching for hidden illicit sources of gamma radiation in an urban environment is difficult. Background radiation profiles are variable and cluttered with transient acquisitions from naturally occurring radioactive materials and medical isotopes. Potentially threatening sources likely will be nearly hidden in this noise and encountered at high standoff distances and low threat count rates. We discuss an anomaly detection algorithm that characterizes low count sources as threatening or non-threatening and operates well in the presence of high benign source variability. We discuss the algorithm parameters needed to reliably find sources both close to the detector and far away from it. These parameters include the cutoff frequencies of background tracking filters and the integration time of the spectrometer. This work is part of the development of the Standoff Radiation Imaging System (SORIS) as part of DNDO's Standoff Radiation Detection System Advanced Technology Demonstration (SORDS-ATD) program.},

abstract = {This manuscript profiles an unattended and fully autonomous radiation detection system sensitive to gamma-ray and neutron emissions. The Lynx design is intended for locations that require radiation detection capabilities for detection of special nuclear materials but lack supporting infrastructure. Signal-starved data is common in these environments since little or no control may be exerted over measurement conditions. The fundamental sensing elements of the Lynx system are traditional NaI(Tl) and 3He detectors. The new developments reported here center on two themes: low-power electronics and computationally simple analysis algorithms capable of discriminating gamma-ray signatures indicative of special nuclear materials from those of naturally occurring radioactive material. Incorporating tripwire-detection algorithms based on gamma-ray spectral signatures into a low-power electronics package significantly improves performance in environments where sensors encounter nuisance sources.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate detection and classification of buried radioactive materials of interest using data collected by a Sodium Iodide (NaI) detector with short sensor dwell time (i.e., less than or equal to 1 s). Due to the sparseness and randomness of a gamma spectrum, four different spectral transforms are implemented as mechanisms for background normalization and feature extraction. These spectral transforms are based on binned energy windows determined by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. However, the overall process is time-consuming. Since parallel computation is an appropriate approach to reduce the computation burden of the PSO-based search process, the parallel implementation on cluster for optimal bin partition is proposed in this paper. The speedup performance and resulting detection and classification performance are investigated.},

abstract = {We investigate buried depleted uranium detection and classification using data collected with short sensor dwell time (i.e., less than or equal to 1s). Under this circumstance, the gamma spectroscope collected by a NaI detector can be sparse and random, and may be severely affected by energy counts from the background. Several spectral transformations using binned energy windows can help alleviate the negative effect from background spectral noisy variation. The simplest way for such spectral partition is to use a fixed bin-width for uniform partition. In this paper, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based optimization method to automatically determine the varied bin-width for each energy window. The experimental result shows that the spectral transformation methods using PSO-selected bins with variable widths can outperform those with a fixed bin-width.},

abstract = {Estimation of covariance matrices in small samples has been studied by many authors. Standard estimators, like the unstructured maximum likelihood estimator (ML) or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimator, can be very unstable with the smallest estimated eigenvalues being too small and the largest too big. A standard approach to more stably estimating the matrix in small samples is to compute the ML or REML estimator under some simple structure that involves estimation of fewer parameters, such as compound symmetry or independence. However, these estimators will not be consistent unless the hypothesized structure is correct. If interest focuses on estimation of regression coefficients with correlated (or longitudinal) data, a sandwich estimator of the covariance matrix may be used to provide standard errors for the estimated coefficients that are robust in the sense that they remain consistent under misspecification of the covariance structure. With large matrices, however, the inefficiency of the sandwich estimator becomes worrisome. We consider here two general shrinkage approaches to estimating the covariance matrix and regression coefficients. The first involves shrinking the eigenvalues of the unstructured ML or REML estimator. The second involves shrinking an unstructured estimator toward a structured estimator. For both cases, the data determine the amount of shrinkage. These estimators are consistent and give consistent and asymptotically efficient estimates for regression coefficients. Simulations show the improved operating characteristics of the shrinkage estimators of the covariance matrix and the regression coefficients in finite samples. The final estimator chosen includes a combination of both shrinkage approaches, i.e., shrinking the eigenvalues and then shrinking toward structure. We illustrate our approach on a sleep EEG study that requires estimation of a 24 x 24 covariance matrix and for which inferences on mean parameters critically depend on the covariance estimator chosen. We recommend making inference using a particular shrinkage estimator that provides a reasonable compromise between structured and unstructured estimators.},

abstract = {The scanning of cargo for radiological and nuclear material is vital in detecting the illicit trafficking of such materials. The deployment of technologies such as Radiation Portal Monitors (RPMs) has enabled screening for the presence of gamma and neutron emitting radionuclides.
Although the development of radionuclide detection algorithms is vital to the development of RPMs, only a small amount of the work exists in the published literature. This paper describes the development of an anomalous signature detection algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA involves the eigen decomposition of the correlation matrix of a training data set. The distance of an unknown observed spectrum from Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM), in a 14 dimensional space, was used to assess the algorithm performance.
The PCA algorithm showed an excellent 'anomaly detection' performance for a number of threat sources including Special Nuclear Materials (SNM's). The PCA algorithm has also demonstrated an improved performance over that of a commercially available peak search algorithm. The discrimination of the SNM's sources, from the NORM, consistently improved with increased counts, which is not always true for peak search based algorithms. The algorithm also performed well in count starved spectra, which is of relevance to border security applications of RPMs.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false dsicovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},
